Topic: Preventing outbreaks and forming connected nature of hospitals.
About: As the population grows so does disease. Even as humanity copes with the COVID-19 pandemic, which is far from over, other outbreaks such as  monkeypox, Zika virus, Ebola virus, SARS and more. This highlights how rising populations have enabled faster spread of zoonotic, vector-borne diseases and epidemics snap at the heels highlighting the need for preventive healthcare. So, the need to monitor and study pattern for such outbreaks has become the need. ML models provide the link between these outbreaks and hope to determine and prevent such more incidents. This project aims to establish such a model within the healthcare organizations to monitor the patients and the health records to prevent outbreaks as well as to develop a connected nature of hospital-patient relationship.
